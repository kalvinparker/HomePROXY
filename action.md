### **Action Plan: Debug the `Caddyfile`**

The container is crash-looping because of a syntax error or a logical problem in your `Caddyfile`. We need to view the logs to see the specific error.

**Step 1: View the Container Logs**

Since the container is restarting, `docker compose logs` is the perfect tool.

1.  In your `~/caddy-project` directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs caddy
    ```

2.  This will show you the startup logs from the container each time it has tried to start. You will see the same error message repeated. **Look for the last block of logs.** It will contain a line that starts with `Error:`.

**Common `Caddyfile` Errors to Look For:**

*   **Placeholder Values:** The most likely cause is that you still have a placeholder value in your `Caddyfile`. You must replace:
    *   `your-duckdns-domain.duckdns.org`
    *   `{$DUCKDNS_TOKEN}` (This part is correct, it should stay as is to read the environment variable)
    *   `your-email@example.com`
    *   `vault.your-noip-domain.ddns.net`
    *   `192.168.1.6:8080` (Ensure this IP and port are correct for your Vaultwarden)
*   **Missing Brackets:** Make sure the global `dynamic_dns` block is fully enclosed in `{ ... }`.
*   **DNS Resolution Failure:** Caddy needs to be able to resolve the domains you listed (`vault.your-noip-domain.ddns.net`, etc.) to a public IP address to get a certificate. Ensure your No-IP CNAME is pointing to your DuckDNS name, and your DuckDNS name is pointing to your public IP.

**Step 2: Fix the `Caddyfile` and Restart**

1.  Based on the error you see in the logs, edit your `Caddyfile`:
    ```bash
    nano Caddyfile
    ```
2.  Make the necessary corrections.
3.  Save the file.
4.  Now, restart the service. Docker will automatically use the updated `Caddyfile` you saved.
    ```bash
    docker compose restart caddy
    ```
5.  Check the logs again to see if the error is gone:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs caddy
    ```
6.  Once the error is gone and the logs show a clean startup, you can verify the container is stable:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
    It should show a status of "Up". Once it's stable and "Up", *then* you can use the `caddy reload` command for any future changes.

You are at the finish line. The hard part (building the custom image) is done. Now you are just doing standard configuration. Find the error in the log, fix it in your `Caddyfile`, and restart the container.
